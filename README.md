# FinalProject
Recipe Book
Team: Midnight Sparkle
Team Members: Aspen Newman, Cullen Rafferty, Nolan Urban

# Overview

What began as a way to communicate produce item price checking across localities morphed into a project where recipes could be
auto populated with ingredients from outside stores.  Coupling this feature with CRUD operations we were able to create a
social media-esque website that allows for user and recipe creation with additional search features for things like ingredients
and commentary on recipes.  

# Technologies & Tools

Java/Eclipse, Angular (TS)/VSCode, JS, SpringBoot, Gradle, SpringJPA, MySQL/Atom, GitHub

# Goals

1. Establish a full stack application that works with existing technologies used in class.
2. Incorporate a flow between MySQL database software, Eclipse, and VS Code to create the application
3. Work together as a team to design, set goals, sprint, and debug an application
4. Present a working application as a final project

# Highlights

- Fully working database for users to populate at will with recipes, images, and commentary
- Users can publish or de-publish their recipes from public view
- Users can see live views for ingredients in their area at Kroger stores using the Kroger api
- Users can not only conduct normal CRUD operations with their information but also save others' recipes into their profile


# Hindrances

A multitude of personal life challenges came about the group during the end phase of this project leading to a bit more stress
on the actual programming sprint.  Additionally, odd challenges such as working with composite keys, dealing with some software
inefficiencies in the databasing, and also, at times, finicky CSS issues.
